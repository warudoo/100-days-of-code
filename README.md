## The Challenge

I am committing to the #100DaysOfCode challenge. The two main rules are:
1. Code for a minimum of one hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Push my progress to this GitHub repository every day.

## Main Goals

By the end of this 100-day period, I aim to have achieved the following:
- üíª **Master Python:** Gain a deep and practical understanding of Python and its ecosystem.
- üß† **Conquer DSA:** Develop strong problem-solving skills through a solid grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms.
- üåê **Build for the Web:** Learn to build dynamic web applications using Python frameworks like Django or Flask.
- ü§ñ **Explore AI/ML:** Understand the foundational concepts of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and build simple models.
- ‚õìÔ∏è **Understand Web3:** Get a conceptual understanding of blockchain technology and smart contracts.
